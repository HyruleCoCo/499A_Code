# 2023-2024 Over Under Code Explinations
This year we started using the JAR template for the first time, our first program this season being `Jar_Acorn`

Dont ask me why we made 3 different program files, I dont remember why we did- it was probably because we were used to seperate files but ðŸ¤·
## Jar Acorn

This is the first program we made this season, we were mostly messing around and learning how the Jar Template works.

It includes some code that was used in the 2022-2023 season Spin Up, such as the seperate arcade drive code- the rest of the spin up code has sadly been lost

## Strombolacorn_arcade
This was the first competition code we used and competed with, most of the code we have used in this have ended up being apart of the final code we use in this season

This includes some code found in `Jar_Acorn` such as temp.cpp, where we print motor temperatures to the brain

## Strombol Acorns

This is the final code file that we used in this season, and the one we competed with at States

This is mostly the same code that is in `Strombolacorn_arcade` with the main difference being the inclusion of gifclass

Gifclass is code from  jpearmans repository [vexcode-gifdemo](https://github.com/jpearman/vexcode-gifdemo) which allowes us to include gif files that actually run on our brain screen
